			<h3>Activating your Plugin</h3>

			<p>To integrate WolfNet IDX data with your WordPress website, you must have the following:</p>

			<ol>

				<li>A WolfNet IDX property search solution – if you do not have a WolfNet IDX property search solution, please contact WolfNet Sales via phone at 612-342-0088 or toll free at 1-866-WOLFNET, or via email at <a href="mailto:sales@wolfnet.com">sales@wolfnet.com</a>.</li>

				<li>A unique plugin product key – you must contact WolfNet Technologies to obtain your unique plugin product key.  Please contact WolfNet Customer Service via phone at 612-342-0088 or toll free at 1-866-WOLFNET, or via email at <a href="mailto:service@wolfnet.com">service@wolfnet.com</a>.</li>

			</ol>

			<p>To activate your WolfNet IDX for WordPress plugin, your unique plugin product key must be entered and validated within the WolfNet section of your WordPress dashboard. In the left navigation, choose WolfNet &gt; General Settings. Enter your product key and Save Changes. A green checkmark indicates that your product key has been validated.  A red X indicates that your product key is invalid.</p>

		<div id="overview">

			<h3>Overview</h3>

			<p>The WolfNet IDX for WordPress Plugin features several options to integrate your WolfNet IDX property search into your WordPress website, either as a widget or via shortcode.</p>

			<ol>

				<li>
					<strong>WolfNet Featured Listings</strong> can be used to add a scrollable display of your featured properties.  The featured listings display consists of an image, price, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and address information.
					{{'support-featured-listings.png'|thumbnailLink()}}
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>WolfNet Property List</strong> can be used to display a text list of properties based on defined criteria.  The property list display consists of address and price information.
					{{'support-list.png'|thumbnailLink()}}
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>WolfNet Listing Grid</strong> can be used to display a grid of properties based on defined criteria.  The grid display consists of an image, price, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and address information.
					{{'support-grid.png'|thumbnailLink()}}
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>WolfNet Quick Search</strong> can be used to add a quick search form to your website.  When a quick search is executed, the user is directed to the applicable search results within your WolfNet IDX property search solution.  The quick search form includes location, listing number, price, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms search options.
					{{'support-quicksearch.png'|thumbnailLink()}}
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Search Manager</strong> can be used to pre-define criteria to return a specific subset of properties.  This feature is comparable to the URL Search Builder feature that is available in your WolfNet BackOffice.
					{{'support-search-manager.png'|thumbnailLink()}}
				</li>

			</ol>

		</div>

		<div id="search-manager">

			<h3>Using the Search Manager</h3>

			<p>The Search Manager feature can be found within the WolfNet section of your WordPress dashboard. In the left navigation, choose WolfNet &gt; Search Manager.</p>

			<p>The Search Manager interface features a replica of your WolfNet IDX property search solution, including all search features that are available on your actual property search solution. You can select criteria as if you were executing a search on your actual property search solution. Once satisfied with the criteria selected, you can name and save the criteria. The saved search criteria can then be applied to a widget or as shortcode within a page or post.</p>
