/**
 * API Client Caching Decorator
 *
 * This class is meant to decorator (see Decorator Pattern) the ApiClient class and apply caching
 * logic to it's requests. We are doing it this way to maintain separation of concerns, the API need
 * not know anything about caching. A benefit of using a decorator is that we can easily exclude
 * the decorator from the execution of a request (even at run time) when debugging issues,
 * effectively eliminating caching from the equation to ensure it is not the source of any issues.
 *
 * This class uses the WordPress Transients API (see https://codex.wordpress.org/Transients_API) to
 * store (cache) and later retrieve certain API responses. This means that there are fewer requests
 * being made directly to the API server, reducing load and lower response times.
 *
 * Along with the individual requests being cached we also cache a sort of registry which is used to
 * group all of our (WolfNet) entries in the cache. This way we can target them and clear them all
 * explicitly without affecting any other transient data.
