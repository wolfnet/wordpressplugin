/**
 * WolfNet API Authentication Decorator
 *
 * This class decorates the API Client class in order to simplify authentication with the API.
 * Rather than forcing the consumer of the API Client to perform authentication and keep track of
 * the authentication token this class takes care of that work. Any time the consumer would like to
 * make a request to the API it will do so using the sendRequest method and pass in the API Key.
 * This key will then automatically be used to authenticate with the API, retrieve a token, then
 * immediately use that toke to perform the request.
 *
 * NOTE: Because authentication is done with a key while standard requests are made with a token
 * this class slightly modifies the sendRequest method signature. Instead of the first argument
 * being the API Token that would normally be retrieved via an authentication request the consumer
 * will send an API key which this class will use to perform authentication.

     * client reference being decorated.

     * @param  string  $key       The API key to be used to authenticate with the API.

     * @param  string  $method    The HTTP verb that should be used to make the request.
     * @param  array   $data      Any data that should be passed along with the request.
     * @param  array   $headers   The HTTP headers to be sent with the request.
