/**
 * WolfNet Caching Service
 *
 * This class is used for caching wolfnet data and serves as a facade to the WordPress Transients
 * API (see https://codex.wordpress.org/Transients_API). Encapsulating this interaction with the WP
 * API into its own class allows us to apply WolfNet logic to every request to the API.
 *
 * One big aspect of our implementation is that we maintain our own registry of cache keys which we
 * can then use to interact with all cache items that are WolfNet specific. This allows us to do
 * things such as delete all WolfNet specific cache items while still only interacting with the API
 * that WordPress provides, making our plugin fully compatible with other plugins or WordPress
 * extensions which might completely change the way the Transients API works. For example, a site
 * may use a plugin which uses Memcached for caching instead of the database.
